# feedback_gitlab

## ðŸš€ Getting Started

### Setup

First, you will need to add `feedback_gitlab` to your `pubspec.yaml`.
The latest version is <a href="https://pub.dev/packages/feedback_gitlab"><img src="https://img.shields.io/pub/v/feedback_gitlab.svg" alt="pub.dev"></a>.

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  feedback_gitlab: x.y.z # use the latest version found on pub.dev
```

Then, run `flutter pub get` in your terminal.

### Use it

Just wrap your app in a `BetterFeedback` widget.
To show the feedback view just call `BetterFeedback.of(context).show(...);`.
The callback gets called when the user submits his feedback. 

```dart
import 'package:feedback/feedback.dart';
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(
    BetterFeedback(
      child: const MyApp(),
    ),
  );
}
```

Provide a way to show the feedback panel by calling 
```dart
  BetterFeedback.of(context).showAndUploadToDiscord(
    channel: '#discord-feedback',
    discordUrl: 'https://discord.com/api/webhooks/',
 );
```
Provide a way to hide the feedback panel by calling  `BetterFeedback.of(context).hide();`
