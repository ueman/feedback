      üßê **Guidelines:**

      - Search through [existing issues](https://github.com/ueman/feedback/issues?q=is%3Aissue) first to ensure that this bug has not been reported before.
      - Write a descriptive title for your issue. Avoid generic or vague titles such as "Something's not working" or "A couple of problems".
      - Keep your issue focused on one single problem. If you have multiple bug reports, please create separate issues for each of them.
      - Provide as much context as possible in the details section. Include screenshots, screen recordings, links, references, or anything else you may consider relevant.
      - If you want to ask a question instead of reporting a bug, please use [discussions](https://github.com/ueman/feedback/discussions/new) instead.
